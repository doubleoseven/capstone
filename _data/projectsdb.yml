  description: "Interfacing field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to analog - to - digital converter (ADC) output is a 
  common engineering challenge.  This notebook includes an overview of various interface protocols and standards 
  as well as application tips and techniques for utilizing LVDS in high speed data converter implementations."

  description: "This tutorial first derives the theoretical quantization noise of an N-bit
analog-to-digital converter
(ADC). Once the rms quantization noise voltage
is known, the theoretical signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) is computed. The effects of overs
ampling on the SNR are also analyzed. "

  description: "The sample-and-hold amplifier , or SHA, is a critical part of most data acquisition systems.
   It captures an analog signal and holds it duri ng some operation (most commonly analog-digital conversion). 
   The circuitry involved is demandi ng, and unexpected properties of commonplace components 
   such as capacitors and printed circuit boards may degrade SHA performance. "

  description: "Six popular specifications for quantifying ADC dynamic performance are 
  SINAD (signal-to- noise-and-distortion ratio), ENOB (effective number of bits), 
  SNR (signal-to-noise ratio), THD (total harmonic distortion), 
  TH D + N (total harmonic distortion plus noise), and SFDR (spurious free dynamic range). 
  Although most ADC manufacturers have adopted the same definitions for these specifications, 
  some exceptions still exis t. Because of their importance in comparing ADCs, it is important not only to 
  understand exactly what is being specified, but the relationships between the specifications. "

  description: "In t his paper an event - driven (ED) digital signal processing system (DSP) , Analog - to - digital converter (ADC) and Digital - to - analog converter ( DAC) operating in cont inuous - time (CT) with smart dust as the target application is presented . The benefits of the CT system compared to its conventional counterpart are lower in - band quantization noise and no requirement of a clock generator and anti - aliasing filter, which mak es it suitable for processing burst - type data signals.
