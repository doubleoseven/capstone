  description: "Six popular specifications for quantifying ADC dynamic performance are 
  SINAD (signal-to- noise-and-distortion ratio), ENOB (effective number of bits), 
  SNR (signal-to-noise ratio), THD (total harmonic distortion), 
  TH D + N (total harmonic distortion plus noise), and SFDR (spurious free dynamic range). 
  Although most ADC manufacturers have adopted the same definitions for these specifications, 
  some exceptions still exis t. Because of their importance in comparing ADCs, it is important not only to 
  understand exactly what is being specified, but the relationships between the specifications. "

  description: "This work is a part of a drastic revolution in the classical signal processing chain required in mobile systems. The system must be low power as it is powered by a battery. Thus a signal driven sam- pling scheme based on level crossing is adopted, delivering non- uniformly spaced out in time sampled points. In order to analyse the non-uniformly sampled signal obtained at the output of this sam- pling scheme a new spectral analysis technique is devised. The idea is to combine the features of both uniform and non-uniform signal processing chains in order to obtain a good spectrum quality with low computational complexity. The comparison of the proposed technique with General Discrete Fourier transform and Lomb’s algorithm shows significant improvements in terms of spectrum quality and computational complexity."

  description: "Nowadays, since more and more batteryoperated devices are involved in applications with continuous sensing, development of an efficient sampling mechanisms is an important issue for these applications. In this paper, we investigate power efficiency aspects of a recently proposed adaptive nonuniform sampling. This sampling scheme minimizes the energy consumption of the sampling process, which is approximately proportional to sampling rate. The main characteristics of our method are that, first, sampling times do not need to be transmitted, since the receiver can compute them by using a function of previously taken samples, and second, only innovative samples are taken from the signal of interest, reducing the sampling rate and therefore the energy consumption. We call this scheme Time-Stampless Adaptive Nonuniform Sampling (TANS). TANS can be used in several scenarios, showing promising results in terms of energy savings, and can potentially enable the development of new applications that require continuous signals sensing, such as applications related to health monitoring, location tracking and entertainment."
